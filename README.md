# Bayesian-Deep-Learning

Short intro about BDL:

Bayesian Deep Learning is an active area of research, combining two things:

1. Probabilistic modelling: using probability distributions to represent models, perform inference on parameters, and quantify uncertainty in predictions.

2. Learning representations: approaches which automatically identify useful “features”, rather than require them to be speciﬁed by hand (used in state of the art methods for com p uter vision, machine translation, audio transcription, etc.).
